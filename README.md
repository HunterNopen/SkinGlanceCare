# SkinGlanceCare

SkinGlanceCare - AI-powered app designed to help users assess the health of their skin without preliminary doctor's visit. By simply taking a photo of a suspicious skin area, users receive an AI-based assessment indicating whether the skin appears healthy or not. This project’s mission is to empower individuals with quick, accessible, and early insights into their skin health, potentially encouraging timely medical consultation.

## 🚀 Project Goal

- **Empower early detection:** Enable users to easily check skin spots or moles for potential issues.
- **Accessible AI health checks:** Bring AI-powered skin health evaluation to anyone with a smartphone.
- **Raise awareness:** Encourage users to monitor their skin and consult professionals as needed.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Mobile-focused (React Native)
- **Backend:** Python (Python)
- **AI/ML:** Deep learning model for image classification (PyTorch, Lightning & Utility Libs as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Numpy...)
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints for communication between the app and backend
- **Deployment:** Docker Containers

---

## 🧠 Strategies

- **Image processing:** Users upload or capture skin area images, which are pre-processed for analysis.
- **AI-based classification:** A trained deep learning model analyzes images to determine if the skin area is healthy or suspicious.
- **Security & Privacy:** All photos and user data are handled securely and confidentially.
- **User guidance:** The app provides clear results and encourages users to seek professional diagnosis if signs of risk are detected.

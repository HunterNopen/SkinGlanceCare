        Our solution was born out of a deeply personal need. It all started with
        a situation that could happen to anyone—noticing a new, concerning skin
        lesion. For some of us, this was a particularly sensitive issue due to
        family experiences with melanoma. We soon realized that many people
        share these same anxieties—moles, spots, or other skin changes
        eventually appear on almost everyone. Despite this, most people tend to
        downplay these signs or postpone a specialist visit. The most common
        reasons are a lack of time, limited access to doctors, or the belief
        that "it's probably nothing." In the fight against disease, early
        reaction and prevention are key. Importantly, a basic dermatological
        exam is simple, painless, and relies primarily on a visual assessment.
        We began to wonder if technology could help break down these barriers
        and make it easier for people to take care of their health. With the
        rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the universal access to
        smartphones with high-quality cameras, it has become possible to combine
        observation and analysis into one easily accessible tool. Our app uses
        AI for the preliminary analysis of skin lesions and potential risk
        assessment. While it is not a replacement for a doctor or a professional
        diagnosis, it serves as a crucial first step—fast, convenient, and
        accessible—that encourages further testing and consultation. We believe
        that technology can truly support health prevention and help people
        react faster, before it’s too late.{" "}
